# The method to calculate the player time!
# Options:
# - first-join = Count the time since the first login on server (after ResProtect installation). This includes the time the player is offline.
# - online-time = Count only the online time. When the player is offline, the time pauses.
# Important: Using 'online-time', we will use a thread to count and add the time for all online players. Using 'first-join' use no new threads.

# The unit type to give claim blocks to players?
# Options:
# - d = x blocks for every day
# - h = x blocks for every hour
# - m = x blocks for every minute
# - s = x blocks for every second
